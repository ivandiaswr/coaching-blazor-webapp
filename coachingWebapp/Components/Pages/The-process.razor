            Have you ever felt lost? Stuck? Not knowing what to do next with your life? 
            Feeling like no matter how many therapies you tried or where you turned to before, nothing seemed to work? It’s as if you’d reached the end of the road, shattered by circumstances or by what others did to you or those you love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps the answer is no. However, you have recently graduated but do not know where to turn to, next? Or maybe you do know what and where to turn next, but do not want to follow the conventional 9-5 conventions of working for someone else? And would like to start something afresh, for yourself?
        </p>
        <p>
            Or maybe, you just find yourself in that stage in life where you feel stagnated? Or you have been sensing that you could be doing much more, but something keeps holding back? Want to find out what such blockers are and let go and let yourself grow?
            Are you finding yourself overwhelmed and stressed, lately?
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever your reason. If you are reading this, could it be that you are searching for a significance, change, and peace in your life? A shift in your midset? A shift in your decision and planning process, to help you close the gap between where you ar right now and where you would like to be, instead?
        </p>
        <p>
            Or simply, you are ready for a change?
            And you want to see transformational and impactful changes in your life? While searching for a shift in behavioural patterns and on how things have been unfolding in your life?
        </p>
        <p class="bold-text">You are not alone. I’ve been there too.</p>
        <p>
