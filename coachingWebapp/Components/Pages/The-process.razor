            Have you ever felt lost? Stuck? So broken inside that no matter how many therapies you tried or where you turned to, nothing seemed to work? 
            It’s as if you’d reached the end of the road, shattered by circumstances or by what others did to you or those you love.
        </p>
        <p class="bold-text">You’re not alone. I’ve been there too.</p>
        <p>
            But here’s where everything can change: This is where you <strong>stop merely existing</strong> and <strong>start truly living</strong>.

        <h2>Introducing JOSTIC</h2>
        <p>
            I retrained as a Life Coach and Mentor and developed <strong>JOSTIC</strong>, a lived and proven 
            <em>Life Liberation Methodology™</em>. It’s designed to empower and give a voice to the suppressed, confused, and trapped emotions we all carry inside, 
            while guiding people to break free and start thriving in every area of life.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong></p>
        <p>
            This methodology isn’t just about healing or self-discovery—it’s about mastering your journey and empowering every aspect of your life.
