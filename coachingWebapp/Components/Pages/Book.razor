            <p class="lead">Written for every soul that’s ever felt lost, unseen, or too broken to begin again.</p>

            <p class="excerpt">
                When your world falls apart, where does hope hide?
            </p>

            <p>
                What if the breaking was never meant to destroy you — but to awaken you?
            </p>

            <p>
                In <strong>Awaken: Finding Hope Beyond Brokenness</strong>, poet and life coach, Ítala Veloso, shares a
                testimony in verse — written for every soul that’s ever felt lost, unseen, or too broken to begin again.
            </p>

            <p>
                These poems are not polished prayers — they are raw honesty, battle cries, tear-stained revelations and
                encounters with grace. Ítala walks with you from the depths of despair to the freedom of faith.
            </p>

            <p>
                Her words are prayers in motion, carrying the ache of human pain and the healing of God’s love. A
                journey
                through pain, surrender, and the miraculous forgiveness and rebirth that only love in Christ can bring.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Awaken</em> is a call to the lost, the broken, the weary, the doubting: to remember who you are,
                whose
                you are, and that no valley is too deep for resurrection.
            </p>

            <p class="invitation">Come as you are. You are not forgotten. You are not alone. You are already being made
                new.</p>
