            <h2>1. Will life coaching work for me?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, life coaching can work for you—but the results depend on your commitment and intention.
                Success is 97% dependent on how ready you are to show up, do the hard work, follow guidances and trust the process entirely.
                Self-sabotage and hesitation can hold you back, but with guidance and effort, transformation is achievable.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>5. Is life coaching the same as therapy?</h2>
            <p>
                No. Life Coaching is not therapy. While therapy often focuses on healing past wounds and managing mental health conditions, life coaching is future-focused.
                It’s about setting goals, breaking barriers, and creating actionable strategies to achieve the life you want. Life Coaching complements therapy but does not replace it.
